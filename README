# newToNodeJs_NodeProblem-

## This is my first attempt to produce a readme.md generator. The purpose of this was to help a potential user organize a portfolio for an upcoming project and to show off their previous work cited through their GitHub account with all their previous repositories. A user is able to give a project a title and it's description, how to install it and how it will be used, what licenses will be used, who and what is contributing to the project, how it will be tested, and is able to leave contact information.

### Credits go out to UC Berkley for their added help including and not limited to Robbert, our instructor.
